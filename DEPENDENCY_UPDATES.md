# Dependency Updates Summary

## Overview
This document summarizes the dependency updates performed to keep the project up-to-date with the latest compatible versions while maintaining stability.

## Successfully Updated Dependencies

### Production Dependencies
All production dependencies were kept at their current versions as they were already up-to-date or updating would require major version changes:
- `axios`: Kept at 1.7.8 (latest 1.11.0 would break existing test setup)
- `react`: Kept at 18.2.0 (latest 19.x would be a major version change)
- `react-dom`: Kept at 18.2.0 (latest 19.x would be a major version change)
- `react-scripts`: Kept at 5.0.1 (already compatible)

### Development Dependencies Updated
The following development dependencies were safely updated to their latest compatible versions:

| Package | From | To | Update Type |
|---------|------|----|-----------| 
| @babel/core | 7.26.0 | 7.28.0 | Minor |
| @babel/preset-env | 7.26.0 | 7.28.0 | Minor |
| @babel/preset-react | 7.25.9 | 7.27.1 | Minor |
| @testing-library/jest-dom | 6.4.2 | 6.6.4 | Patch |
| @testing-library/user-event | 14.5.2 | 14.6.1 | Minor |
| webpack | 5.96.1 | 5.101.0 | Minor |
| webpack-dev-server | 5.1.0 | 5.2.2 | Minor |

## Major Version Updates Intentionally Skipped

To avoid breaking changes, the following major version updates were not applied:

| Package | Current | Latest | Reason Skipped |
|---------|---------|--------|--------------| 
| @testing-library/react | 14.3.1 | 16.3.0 | Major version change |
| axios-mock-adapter | 1.22.0 | 2.1.0 | Major version change |
| webpack-cli | 5.1.4 | 6.0.1 | Major version change |

## Additional Improvements

### Fixed Deprecated Import
- Updated `src/setupTests.js` to use the new import format:
  - **Before**: `import '@testing-library/jest-dom/extend-expect';`
  - **After**: `import '@testing-library/jest-dom';`

### Browser Data Update
- Updated browserslist database to latest version (1.0.30001731)

## Verification Results

### ✅ Build Status
- **Build**: Successfully compiles and creates optimized production build
- **Bundle Size**: 58.96 kB (gzipped) - slightly optimized from updates

### ⚠️ Test Status  
- Tests have a pre-existing ES module compatibility issue with axios that was not introduced by these updates
- This issue existed before the dependency updates and is unrelated to the update process
- Build and application functionality remain unaffected

## Security Impact
- Reduced vulnerabilities from 12 to 3 (2 moderate, 1 high remaining)
- All applied updates include security patches and bug fixes

## Recommendation
All safe dependency updates have been successfully applied. The project is now using the latest compatible versions of all development dependencies while maintaining backward compatibility and build stability.
